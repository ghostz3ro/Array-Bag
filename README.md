# Array-Bag

Welcome to the BagExtensionsTest project!

This project is a Java class that tests a number of methods for an ArrayBag class. 
ArrayBag is a class that represents a bag (a collection of objects) implemented as an array.

The BagExtensionsTest class has a number of private static fields that represent instances of the ArrayBag class, each of which is initialized with a 
specific set of elements for testing purposes.

The main method of the BagExtensionsTest class calls a number of other methods, each of which tests a specific method of the ArrayBag class. 
These methods are:

    checkEquals: Tests the equals method of the ArrayBag class, which determines if two bags are equal to each other.
    checkRemove: Tests the remove method of the ArrayBag class, which removes a specific element from the bag.
    checkDuplicateAll: Tests the duplicateAll method of the ArrayBag class, which creates a new bag that contains all the elements 
    of the original bag, with each element duplicated.
    checkRemoveDuplicates: Tests the removeDuplicates method of the ArrayBag class, which removes all duplicate elements from the bag.

The BagExtensionsTest class also has a number of other helper methods, such as initializeBags, which is used to reset the elements of the test bags 
to their original state for testing purposes.

Overall, this project is designed to test the functionality of the ArrayBag class and ensure that it is working correctly.
